                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;This documentation is designed to help users understand how to connect APPs with Tweet C.A.R.D. API. 
                                        Before starting. Besides, it could also let users get more familiar with the services that the API offered.</p>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Tweet C.A.R.D. is a recommendation system API.
                                         It would make recommendations with credit card offers, such as cash back, movies discount, parking discount, discount in gas station,
                                          and bonus rewards. </p>
                                    <p>Now, we’ll introduce the services that the API provides:</p>
                                    <p>&emsp;◎Recommendations for credit cards that users already have when they shopping.
                                    <br/>&emsp;◎Recommendations for applying for new cards.
                                    <br/>&emsp;◎A quick link to bank’s website page for users to apply for the new cards.
                                    <br/>&emsp;◎A rank list for each bank to understand its users’ consuming behaviors more through book keeping records that include users’ &emsp;cash flow and credit card transactions that from other banks.
                                    <br/>&emsp;◎Analyses and graphs for banks to know the performance after connecting to the API.</p>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The API is designed for book keeping Apps now. With the development of Open Banking,
                                         the API could get more information through banks. Thus, this API would be available for more other APPs.</p>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;With Tweet C.A.R.D. API, you can add extra value as a book keeping application.
                                         You can easily outperform other book keeping applications for the function of recommendations. We offer experience </p>

                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Before you can begin working with Tweet C.A.R.D. API on iOS, first of all, 
                                        please make sure that your APP is on the latest version of Xcode. Second, get an API key. 
                                        To use C.A.R.D. SDK, you must have an API key. The API key is a unique identifier that is used to 
                                        authenticate requests associated with your project for usage and billing purposes.</p>

                                    <p>The following steps will show you how to get an API key:</p>
                                    <p>&emsp;1. Visit the official website of Tweet C.A.R.D. API.
                                    <br/>&emsp;2. Log in or create a new account if you don’t have one.
                                    <br/>&emsp;3. Click the APP button on the left side, select API Credential, and click the Create an API key button.
                                    <br/>&emsp;4. The new page will show you your new API key.
                                    <br/>&emsp;5. The new API key will show on the list, Your API Key, on the API Credential page.</p>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;With our API key, you could connect your APP with this recommendation system. However, to make the recommendation results
                                        better, you should also apply for Google Map API key so that Tweet C.A.R.D. may receive users' locations. Now, we're going to connecting Tweet C.A.R.D. API.</p>

                                         the API will check whether users have the cards that provide the discount and whether users meet the 
                                         conditions to get the offer. Moreover, the API will list the top three credit cards that users can save 
                                         more money by using them. </p>

                                        basic information, and all the credit cards that the user has. Before making recommendations, take the 
                                        user’s income and job occupation into consideration. Last, make sure users’ positions are allowed to 
                                        use the discount that the API recommends.</p>

                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;In addition to the history records from the APP, the API can also get the place that users are when they ask for recommendations. The API will find out the specific place that users are. If the API could not determine by latitude and longitude, users would be thought to be at the place that is nearest to them. On the same time, the place should be in the 5 place types that we mentioned above.</p>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;As we mentioned before, there are new users and regulars. For regulars, the API has already got enough data from their history records to make recommendations. As for new users, we have a cold start problem. Thus, the API will do grouping to make recommendations to new users.</p>
                                    <details><summary><i><b>def find_similar(auth_id):</b></i></summary>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The function is to divide existing users into groups by combining k-means clustering and decision tree. First, read csv file, which includes users’ age, sex, income, average cost per month and preference to several locations, by pandas. Then we use k-means clustering by certain features and get the clustering result, which will be the input of decision tree. After performing decision tree on k-means clustering result, we obtain the classification result of existing users.</p></details><br/>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;When recommending cards that users already have,  the API takes users’ positions, time, users’ moving speed into consideration. Besides, the API would also determine whether users can drive or not to evaluate the importance of discount for parking and gas to users. Those functions below are paying attention to those background information.</p>
                                    <details><summary><i><b>def distance(origin,destinations):</b></i></summary>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;To calculate the distance between the user’s position and the destinations. The destinations are in a list that contains the 5 place types’ positions, and the function will return the one with the shortest distance, namely the one that takes less time.</p></details><BR/>
                                    <details><summary><i><b>def kmean_score_and_tree():</b></i></summary>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The function takes the result of find_similar, and finds the place type that users in the same group usually go. Those place types will get extra points to the new user’s recommendation list.</p></details><br/>
                                    <details><summary><i><b>def tree_to_code(tree, feature_names,feature_value):</b></i><br/>&emsp;
                                        <i><b>def classification_(clf,group_place_score,feature_value,feature_cols,context_sum):
                                        </b></i></summary>
                                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;After obtaining the decision tree and the feature value of the current user, the function <i>classification_</i> will classify the user by <i>tree_to_code</i> and add points according to the preference of the group.</p></details><br/>
                                        <details><summary><i><b>def can_drive_or_not(id_number):</b></i></summary>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The function is to know whether users can drive or not. First, through users’ accounting records, we can know whether users have spent money on gas or parking fees or not. Second, the function will take their preference of place and preference of discount to know whether gas or parking fees are important to their daily life. Last, the function will return yes or no according to the result from the first two steps.</p></details><br/>
                                    <details><summary><i><b>def speed(speed_per_hour):</b></i></summary>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;After knowing whether users can drive or not, we separate them with three situations. First one is that users can drive and their speed is over 30 km/hr, discount for gas and for parking fee will add three points. Second one is that users can drive and their speed is below 30 km/hr, discount for gas and for parking fee will add one point. Last one is that users cannot drive, then no point will be added.</p></details><br/>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Next, we’ll introduce two algorithms that the API offered to make recommendations. Both algorithms will contain those above-mentioned functions. The APP owners could choose one of the algorithms according to their own preference. </p>
                                    <details><summary><i><b>def book_keeping_record_by_freq(auth_id, context_sum, weight):</b></i></summary>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The first one is to count the frequency of each place type in the user’s book keeping record. to predict the user’s preference and recommend him/her the related credit card discount.</p></details><br/>
                                    <details><summary><i><b>def book_keeping_record_by_time(auth_id, context_sum, weight):</b></i></summary>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The second one is to put more emphasis on users’ habits from the aspect of time. For instance, on Tuesday noon (12 p.m.), the user could get the recommendations that are according to the place type that he/she had been to during the past several Tuesdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the recent two months. Among the records that matched the restrictions, the place type on the record that is closer to 12 a.m. would get a higher point.</p></details><br/>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Those above-mentioned recommendations only focus on the credit cards that users have had. Next, we’ll introduce the recommendations focus on the credit cards that users might be interested in</p>
                                    <details><summary><i><b>def find_place_nearby(lat,lng):</b></i></summary>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;For each place type, the range is that radius equals 5000. The function uses latitude and longitude to check whether the position is in the range or not. If not, this function will calculate how much time it would take from the position the function gets to the 5 place types, and return the smallest result. Otherwise, users are supposed to be exactly at one of the 5 place types.</p></details><br/>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Besides the moment that users ask for recommendations, the API also puts emphasis on users’ habits. Thus, to find out places that each user often visits is also part of work in the API.</p>
                                    <details><summary><i><b>def find_freq_place(auth_id):</b></i></summary>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The function will count the place. If the place is new to the user’s storage, it would be added to the storage and count as 1. Otherwise, the place will be counted one more time in the storage.</p></details><br/>
                                    <details><summary><i><b>def recommend_discount_for_place(auth_id, place):</b></i></summary>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;For each place, the function separates them into two groups. One weighs cash back more, while the other weighs bonus reward more. Next, according to users’ preference of place and preference of discount, they will be classified into those groups to get the recommendations. 5 recommendations will be listed in each group.</p></details><br/>

                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The function is to calculate and rank users’ preference of place type. Moreover, it could also determine which identity the user is, a novice or a regular, combine with other background information, and return the list, recommend_order, with place 
                                    types that had ranked inside the list.</p></details><br/>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The following functions are about recommendations for applying for a new credit card. In this part, two ways of making recommendations are involved. </p>

                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;When users ask for recommendations, the function will receive the positions that they are if the positions are available. After that, call “recommend_discount_for_place(auth_id, place)” in class context to do recommendations.</p></details><br/>
                                    <details><summary><i><b>def recommend_place_for_apply(auth_id):</b></i></summary>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;If users’ positions are not available when they ask for recommendations, the function will find place types that users visit a lot. Then, call the function to return the recommendations. If users are new, the function will call “find_similar(auth_id)” in class context to find similar person first.</p></details><br/>
                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Next part is about recommendations of credit cards that users have had. In this part, those functions need to post, for they need to get users’ positions such as places’ names, latitude, and longitude from the APP. (places that are in the range, r=5, are included.) There are five functions that deal with recommendation requests from 5 different place types. The API would make sure if cash back weighs more than bonus rewards to that user before making recommendations, and those functions will return a list that contains three recommendations.Each place type would have its button. </p>
